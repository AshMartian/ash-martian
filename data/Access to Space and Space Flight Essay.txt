Human Access to Space and Space Flight: A Personal Journey and Vision
For as long as I can remember, I have been captivated by the universe and the mechanics behind how things work. At the age of six, I was already taking apart my toys, driven by an insatiable curiosity to understand their inner workings. This early fascination with dismantling and rebuilding laid the foundation of my lifelong passion for engineering and innovation.
The turning point in my understanding of life’s purpose came when the game "Spore" was released. At 14, I became obsessed with the Space Stage of the game. The concept of terraforming planets, planting the seeds of life, and brightening the light of consciousness deeply resonated with me. It was then that I realized the profound meaning of life: to spread throughout the cosmos. This revelation has been a guiding principle in my life ever since. By that time I was also programming Flash ActionScript apps + games, figuring out how computers work.
In 2015, when SpaceX successfully landed the first Falcon 9 rocket, a new era of space exploration seemed within reach. The achievement of affordable, reusable rockets reignited my hope and belief that life will inevitably find a way to populate the cosmos. This landmark event marked the first step towards Mars colonization, a crucial milestone in solidifying humanity’s future in space. Prior to this, I had often felt disheartened by the stagnation in space flight innovation, doubting whether such advancements were possible within my lifetime. When I learned that it wasn’t only SpaceX pursuing these goals, joined by Blue Origin, it became clear that humanity will colonize the solar system and beyond. 
For the past decade, my commitment to contributing to humanity's return to the Moon and beyond has only grown stronger. My identity is intricately tied to this mission. Changing my last name from Martin to Martian was a symbolic gesture, underscoring my dedication to this cause. It reflects my deep-seated belief that space flight is not just a personal interest but a vital endeavor for humanity’s future. My life’s purpose is to serve the meaning of life to ensure trillions more humans can thrive in space. I've manifested this destiny and must do everything in my power to ensure success.
Space flight represents the ultimate frontier for scientific progress, offering unparalleled opportunities for new discoveries. It provides a chance to establish independent societies that can develop governance structures informed by modern science and human psychology within our lifetime. The ethical imperative to spread life beyond Earth is clear; possessing the capability to do so and choosing not to would be a disservice to our evolutionary potential and a neglect of our responsibility as stewards of life.
My vision aligns seamlessly with Blue Origin’s mission to radically reduce the cost of access to space and enable millions of people to live and work in space for the benefit of Earth. I am eager to leverage my skills and passion to contribute to this bold endeavor, helping to pave the way for humanity's enduring presence in the cosmos.
